                 <p>Bhumi was founded on August 15, 2006 by a group of friends, who believed that every underprivileged child deserves quality education. Since then, Bhumi has transformed this conviction into a volunteering opportunity for Indiaâ€™s youth, launching a snowball effect of nurturing talent on the path to an educated, poverty-free India.</p>
